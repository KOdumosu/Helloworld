# Overview

This project is a simple “Hello World” program created to verify that my Python development environment and GitHub setup are working correctly.  
As an aspiring software engineer, my goal is to strengthen my programming foundation by practicing how to write, test, and publish code effectively.  

The program displays a friendly message — **“Hello World from Kehinde!”** — showing that everything is properly configured.
